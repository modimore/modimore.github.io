### Personal Projects

#### [Breezeblocks](https://github.com/modimore/breezeblocks)

Breezeblocks is a **Python** package for generating and executing SQL statements,
then getting the results back in Python. It uses the **builder pattern** to allow
the user to flexibly construct queries, inserts, updates, and deletes.

#### [Discord Dice Bot](https://github.com/modimore/Discord-Dice-Bot)

A while back I made a dice-rolling bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com) chat
servers. It is written in **Python**. I originally made the bot nearer to when
Discord was released for a D&D group I was playing with. I keep a bot running on
**Heroku** which is also used by tabletop RPG groups I am not playing with.
