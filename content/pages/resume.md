I am currently working as a **Salesforce** platform developer and release
manager. As a developer I work on web applications, process automation,
and system integration mostly using **JavaScript**, **Apex** (like Java),
and **SOQL** (like SQL). As release manager I review and merge feature
workstreams using **Git** and deploy using the **Salesforce metadata API**
and **Salesforce DX** tools.

At 1P I developed web-based children's games in **JavaScript** and **Haxe**.
Primarily I worked on a multi-stage game based on a episode of a popular
children's TV show. The remainder were educational games for Elementary school
students integrated into a larger site.

As a computer science mentor I held out-of-class help sessions for students in
Computer Science I and Data Structures, taught with **Python** and **C++**
respectively. I was also a teaching assistant for some CS1 lab sections.

During the summer I maintained and extended an internal **.NET** web application
for monitoring delivery statuses. It was used in a command center for monitoring
the day-to-day health of ground shipping operations.

</h4>

Studied Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. Graduated in 2015 with a
Computer Science Degree. Courses taken include *Operating Systems*,
*Advanced Computer Graphics*, *Database Systems*, *Programming Languages*,
*Software Design and Documentation*, and *Cryptography and Network Security*.

### Personal Projects

#### [Breezeblocks](https://github.com/modimore/breezeblocks)

Breezeblocks is a **Python** package for generating and executing SQL statements,
then getting the results back in Python. It uses the **builder pattern** to allow
the user to flexibly construct queries, inserts, updates, and deletes.

#### [Discord Dice Bot](https://github.com/modimore/Discord-Dice-Bot)

A while back I made a dice-rolling bot for [Discord](https://discordapp.com) chat
servers. It is written in **Python**. I originally made the bot nearer to when
Discord was released for a D&D group I was playing with. I keep a bot running on
**Heroku** which is also used by tabletop RPG groups I am not playing with.
