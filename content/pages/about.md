Title: About Me

I'm Quinn Mortimer, and I'm a professional and recreational software developer.
Recently I have been working on [a SQL abstraction package][breezeblocks] based
on the builder pattern as an exercise in API design and documentation writing,
as well as for **Python** and **SQL** practice. I hope to be able to start using it in
other projects soon. I am also interested in computer graphics and game development.
My favourite programming language is **Python**, but I also have a general fondness
for **Haskell**, **Haxe**, and **C/C++**.

Outside of programming my interests include video games, science fiction, and
manga/anime. Some long-time favourites for each include *Final Fantasy XII*,
*Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*, and *Fullmetal Alchemist*. Recently I
have enjoyed *Dragon Quest VIII*, *2064: Read Only Memories*, and
*Natsuyuki Rendevous*.
