Title: About Me

I'm Quinn Mortimer, and I'm a professional and recreational software developer.
Recently I wrote [a SQL abstraction package][breezeblocks] in **Python** and
have started trying to use it in other programs I am writing. Also I am
working through the [Project Euler][project-euler] problems for general
programming practice.

My favourite programming language is **Python**, but I also enjoy working
in **Haskell**, **Haxe**, and **C/C++**.

Outside of programming my interests include video games, science fiction, and
manga/anime. Some long-time favourites for each include *Final Fantasy XII*,
*Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*, and *Fullmetal Alchemist*. Recently I
have enjoyed *Dragon Quest VIII*, *2064: Read Only Memories*, and
*Magi: The Adventure of Sinbad*.
