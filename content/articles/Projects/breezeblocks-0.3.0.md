Title: BreezeBlocks 0.3.0 Release

The other day I released [version 0.3.0][v0.3.0] of BreezeBlocks. I think
development has been going rather well, though I'm probably going to slow
down a bit on it again. Any effort I choose to put into it would probably be
better spent on documentation than features at this point, and of course on
using it in other stuff. This means for a while the functionality and interface
will remain essentially the same.

One of the most interesting things about this project in my opinion has been
figuring out how to use object-oriented techniques to make the package while
trying to make it more readily usable with some of the other paradigms Python
supports. ORM and Active Record are some of the strongest examples of
object-oriented trying to coerce everything into its own paradigm. Hopefully
by minimizing their influence, BreezeBlocks can more easily fit in with
functional, procedural, or declarative code. Maybe others will feel the same
way.
