Title: Discord Dice Bot

A while ago when Discord I was in a D&D group that was playing over Discord,
and we needed a good dice-roller to use in-chat. I wrote up this bot using
the [Discord API wrapper][discord.py] for Python so we could get pseudo-random
results in-chat.

That D&D group is not meeting currently, but a couple of other groups have
taken up using an instance of the bot named Pythia I keep running on Heroku.
If you'd like to have her roll dice for your group, you can do so [here][add-pythia].
