A web application that aims to be a data-driven information source on Final Fantasy VII.

Sites attempting to provide information on video games are often entirely text- or markup-based, with all information stored as string data types. All videogames use structured data of diverse types in some way, but these sites for the most part do not make use of that.

Limit Manual is designed to allow players access to greater insights about the workings of games by providing access to structured data that can be used in analytical scripts or applications, while also providing a front-end that can  effectively convey summarized information to users less interested in the nitty-gritty technical aspects of the game.
