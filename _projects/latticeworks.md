A grid styling framework written in Sass, intended for customized use through mixins.

Written for use in my other web-based projects, including this one here.

The primary considerations going into this were that it would be customizable and that all features would be opt-in. This is meant to be purely a layout system, so to the highest extent possible cosmetic decisions are left up to the end-user.

The user `@include`s the desired mixins from their _main.scss_ or equivalent file and they are good to go. Multiple variations on the project's core classes can be used in any given project.
