An SQL abstraction layer that allows for flexible querying
and returns lightweight result objects.

This project operates on top of existing DBAPI 2.0 modules,
so it can be used with a large number of database backends
without the user having to write raw SQL into their code.

BreezeBlocks is currently a very-early stage product.
You can read more about it at on [github][github] or at the [Python Package Index][pypi].
