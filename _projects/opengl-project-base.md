An ongoing attempt at putting together some boilerplate code for OpenGL 3.x Projects.

Currently, the scope of the project include creating a general purpose context and window manager, camera, basic input controls, and a simple shader writer, as well as a scene and model base classes which have the interfaces the other parts of the project expect in order to render your scenes.
