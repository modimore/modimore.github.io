Welcome to [modimore.github.io]({{ site.baseurl }}/), the primary web source for information about me, Quinn Mortimer.

I'm a computer programmer/web developer interested in UI design and presenting all types of information in a more easily understandable way. Currently I am interested in providing views of structured data used in video games in order to help players meaningfully understand the differences between equipment and abilities.

If you're interested you can read more about my [coding skills][coding], [development experience][dev], and [interests][interests].
