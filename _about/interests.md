The personal projects I am working on currently are intended to make it easier to play games, but two different types of games and in two different ways. One is an attempt to provide a reference to data about Final Fantasy VII (see [Limit Manual][]). Another is a chat bot that parses complex dice rolls for tabletop RPGs (see [Discord Dice Bot][]).

In the past few months I've also been trying to make boilerplate projects. These projects are intended for eventual personal use, but working on them has also been great experience in its own right. I currently have one for [CSS grid styling][latticeworks] and one for [OpenGL projects][opengl project base].

Eventually I hope to be able to work on web-based editable character sheets for traditional games. I also want to work on projects that are more interactive than traditional web pages, most likely though delving deeper into JavaScript.
