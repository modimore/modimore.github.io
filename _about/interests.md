Outside anything that involves much coding, my interests include playing
videogames and tabletop RPGs, reading fantasy and science fiction, and
watching anime.

When I was in college I served as president of the school's Anime and Science
Fiction viewing club, and was also the video programming coordinator for
[Genericon][], the convention that club runs every spring.
