In terms of what I would like to do, and the type of things I would like to work on, I really enjoy all elements of web application development. Bridging data stored by the computer and the end user of that data has consistently proven interesting to me. I think there's all types of data that can be presented more intuitively or stored more effectively (sometimes both), and one of the most interesting parts of having a hand at all stages of web design is managing the tradeoff between those two goals.

I see opportunities to make technology more effective, from the perspective of all users frequently in my life. Recently the civic responsiblity of jury duty and the pure plaintext content storage as used by Wikia.

I would like to know more about desktop GUI development and computer security, but do not have any projects where I am doing major work in those areas at the moment.

I am also interested in Computer Graphics, optimizing household tasks using technology, and the potential of the computer as a medium for non-traditional art.
